# üß† Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Code-Reasoning (Fine-Tuned)

This is a fine-tuned version of **Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct**, optimized to explain solutions clearly, walk through the code line by line with examples and result in a clear and beginner-friendly format.

It was trained on curated examples where the model (Check it out here: üëâ [Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Code-Reasoning](https://huggingface.co/Stefenn/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Code-Reasoning))
- Explains the **approach before jumping in solutions** with strong reasoning.
- Walks through a **sample input** step-by-step like a dry-run.
- Highlights **common mistakes** and provides **corrections**.
- Keeps the explanation clean, concise, and beginner-readable.
